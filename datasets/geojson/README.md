# GeoJSON
The only country that's missing from this dataset is Antarctica.

Source: The data originally comes from https://github.com/georgique/world-geojson. I have changed a few things to adapt the data to the other datasets. Here's a rough list of changes:
- the file names have been changed from the name of the countries to the respective Alpha-3 code
- some maps have been divided into multiple smaller maps, e.g. China has been divided into China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan or Finland into Finland and Ã…land
- some maps were newly generated by me, e.g. Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands
